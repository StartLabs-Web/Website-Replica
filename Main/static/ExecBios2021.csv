,Ruben Castro,2022,Mechanical Engineering,Co-Director,"My passion in life is machines. Robots, automation, manufacturing all fall under this umbrella. I am an engineer at heart with an entrepreneurial mindset. I want to make machines that benefit the fields of space and media. I've designed machines for research at MIT to be adapted globally, taught a group of high schoolers how to make a 'flying' broom, started a podcast, coded a FRC world champion robot, and much more. On the side, I like to dance Bachata and be social with friends.
